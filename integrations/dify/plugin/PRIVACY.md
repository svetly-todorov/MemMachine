We process this Service Data on your behalf as a data processor and only in accordance with your instructions.

- Automatically Collected Information: We automatically collect certain information when you visit our Website or use our Services, including your IP address, browser type, operating system, device information, pages viewed, and the dates/times of your visits. We may use cookies and similar technologies to collect this information.
