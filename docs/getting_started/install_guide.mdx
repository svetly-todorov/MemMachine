## MemMachine Installation Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of installing MemMachine. We'll start with the prerequisites you need to get set up, followed by two different installation methods.

<Steps>
<Step title="Gather Your Prerequisites">

Before you install the MemMachine software itself, you'll need to set up a few things. Be sure to note down any passwords or keys you create, as you'll need them later.

### A. Core Software

- **Python 3.12+**: MemMachine requires Python version 3.12 or newer.
- **PostgreSQL**: You will need a local PostgreSQL instance with the `pgvector` extension. You can find installation instructions on the official [PostgreSQL Downloads page](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). Once installed, create a new database and a user with full privileges for that database.
- **Neo4j**: A Neo4j database is required.  You can find installation instructions on the official [Neo4j Documentation page](https://neo4j.com/docs/). After installation, start the Neo4j server and set a password for the default `neo4j` user.

### B. Accounts and Keys

- **OpenAI API Key**: You will need an OpenAI account to use MemMachine. You can sign up on the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/). You'll need to generate and copy your **API Key** for a later step.

<Note> MemMachine itself is free to install, but please be aware that using the software consumes tokens from your OpenAI account.</Note>

</Step>
<Step title="Choose Your Installation Method">

You can install MemMachine using a Python package manager or by cloning the source code from our GitHub repository.
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Option 1: Install with Pip">

This is the recommended method for most users who want to add MemMachine to an existing Python environment.

To create a python environment(if it does not already exist), you can use `venv` as follows:
```sh
python -m venv memmachine-env
source memmachine-env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `memmachine-env\Scripts\activate`
```

A. Run the following command in your terminal:

 - If you are using MemMachine in a CPU-only environment, use:
```sh
   pip install memmachine
```
 - If you have an NVIDIA GPU and want to leverage it, use:
```sh
pip install memmachine[gpu]
```
B. Next, install dependencies from NLTK through the following MemMachine command:
```sh
memmachine-nltk-setup
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Option 2: Install from Source (GitHub)">

This method is for users who want to contribute to the project or run from the latest source code.

First, clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

```sh
git clone [https://github.com/MemMachine/MemMachine.git](https://github.com/MemMachine/MemMachine.git)
cd MemMachine
```

Second, Ensure you have a python environment set up. You can use `venv`, `conda`, or any other environment manager of your choice. 


Next, use the `uv` tool to install all dependencies. If you don't have `uv`, you'll need to install it first.

```sh
# If you don't have uv installed, run this command:
curl -LsSf [https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh](https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh) | sh

# Now, install the project dependencies:
uv pip install .
```
<Note> If you wish to run with an NVIDIA GPU, you will need to install dependencies for GPU by using the `uv pip installl ."[gpu]"` command.</Note>
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Create Your Configuration Files">

MemMachine uses two files for configuration: a `.env` file for your database and API credentials and a `config.yml` file for the application's behavior.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="A. Create the `.env` file">

Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project and add the following content.

You can download this file from our GitHub repository as a template using the following curl command:
```sh
curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MemMachine/MemMachine/refs/heads/main/sample_configs/server_config.sample
```
Below is an example of what the `.env` file should look like:
```sh expandable
NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=YOUR_NEO4J_PASSWORD
NEO4J_URI="bolt://localhost:7687"
# Postgres database configuration
POSTGRES_HOST=YOUR_POSTGRES_HOST
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_USER=YOUR_POSTGRES_USER
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=YOUR_POSTGRES_PASSWORD
POSTGRES_DB=YOUR_POSTGRES_DATABASE
MCP_BASE_URL==[http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)
GATEWAY_URL=http://localhost:8080
FAST_MCP_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
MEMORY_CONFIG=config.yml
OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_VALID_OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

<Tip>Replace the placeholders (e.g., `YOUR_NEO4J_PASSWORD`) with your actual values.</Tip>
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="B. Create the `config.yml` file">

Create a file named `config.yml` in the same directory. This file configures the various models and storage options for MemMachine.

You can download this file from our GitHub repository as a template using the following curl command:
```sh
curl -o cfg.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MemMachine/MemMachine/refs/heads/main/sample_configs/episodic_memory_config.sample
```
Below is an example of what the `config.yml` file should look like.  
Please note, if you are using a CPU only installation, be sure to comment out lines 51-53 with a '#', as you will not be able to use the cross-encoder reranker in that environment.
```sh expandable lines

    type: "bm25"
  ce_ranker_id:
    type: "cross-encoder"
    model_name: "cross-encoder/qnli-electra-base"
```
<Tip> Remember to replace the placeholders for your OpenAI API key and Neo4j password in this file as well.</Tip>
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Run MemMachine">

You're ready to go! Run these commands from the directory where you've installed MemMachine.

First, you need to sync the profile schema. This is a **one-time** command that must be run before the very first time you start the server.

```
memmachine-sync-profile-schema
```

Now you can start the MemMachine server. If you have run MemMachine before, you can skip the sync step and go straight to this command:

```
memmachine-server
```

You should now have the MemMachine server running.

<Note> If you are using Docker to run your databases, ensure they are started and accessible before you try to start MemMachine.</Note>
