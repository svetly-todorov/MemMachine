MemMachine uses a client-server architecture. The **Server** manages the storage, retrieval, and processing of memories, while your application uses a **Client** SDK to interact with it.

This guide focuses on getting the **MemMachine Server** up and running.

## Installation

The fastest method to get started with MemMachine is by using Docker and Docker Compose. This approach bundles all necessary components into containers, simplifying the setup process.

### Prerequisites

Before installing MemMachine, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Docker & Docker Compose** - Required to run the server containers.
- **OpenAI API Key** - For language models and embeddings (configured in the server).

### Download and Start the Server

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Docker">
      Make sure that you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your machine.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Download MemMachine and Run">
      <Tabs>
        <Tab title="Linux/MacOS" icon="linux">
          Open your terminal and run the following commands:
          ```bash
          # Download the latest release tarball
          curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/MemMachine/MemMachine/releases/latest \
            | grep "tarball_url" \
            | cut -d '"' -f 4 \
            | xargs curl -L -o MemMachine-latest.tar.gz

          # Extract the release
          tar -xzf MemMachine-latest.tar.gz

          # Enter the folder (GitHub adds a hash to the folder name)
          cd MemMachine-MemMachine-*

          # Run the setup script
          ./memmachine-compose.sh
          ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab title="Windows" icon="windows">
          Use PowerShell to download and run the script:
          ```powershell
          $latestRelease = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.github.com/repos/MemMachine/MemMachine/releases/latest"; `
          $tarballUrl = $latestRelease.tarball_url; `
          $destination = "MemMachine"; `
          if (Test-Path $destination) { Remove-Item $destination -Recurse -Force }; `
          New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $destination; `
          Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $tarballUrl -OutFile "MemMachine-latest.tar.gz"; `
          tar -xzf "MemMachine-latest.tar.gz" -C $destination --strip-components=1; `
          Set-Location $destination; `
          ./memmachine-compose.sh
          ```
        </Tab>
      </Tabs>

      The script will walk you through the setup process, including configuring your OpenAI API key.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Installation">
    Once the script completes, your MemMachine server should be running. You can verify it by checking the health endpoint:

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8080/health
    ```

    You should receive a response indicating the server status is healthy.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps: Connect Your App

Now that the server is running, you need to install the Python Client SDK to interact with it from your application.

## Management Scripts

The `memmachine-compose.sh` script is your main tool for managing the server.

```bash
./memmachine-compose.sh --help
```

Common commands:
- `./memmachine-compose.sh stop` - Stop the services.
- `./memmachine-compose.sh restart` - Restart the services.
- `./memmachine-compose.sh logs` - View server logs.
