## Platform Overview

The MemMachine **Platform Dashboard** serves as your central hub for monitoring usage, accessing API Key information, and managing your account. Think of it as your console's home screen.

### Usage Monitoring (Graphs)

This section displays key metrics related to your **Platform** activity, including API call volume, processing time, and resource consumption. You'll see this area prominently featured: 
![MemMachine Platform Dashboard](./images/dashboard.png)

Since this is a new account, the graphs may initially appear empty, but don't worry!

<Tip>>Data will populate these graphs as soon as you begin making API calls using your generated API keys.</Tip>

The dashboard presents three separate graphs for Usage Monitoring:
 - **Memories** - the number of Memories you have created, adjacent to the current Memory Limit (10000 memories)
    ![Memories Graph](./images/memories-graph.png)
 - **Retrieval API Calls** - the number of API calls you have made, adjacent to the current API Call Limit (1000 memories)
    ![API Calls Graph](./images/api-calls-graph.png)
 - **Memory Retrieval API Usage Trends** - Usage trends grouped by the last 24 hours, the last 7 days, last 30 days, and last 3 months
