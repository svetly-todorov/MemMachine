Welcome to the guide for managing your API Keys in the MemMachine Platform! This page provides clear instructions on how to **create** a new API key and how to **manage** your existing keys over time.

## Viewing and Managing Your API Keys

To review your existing API keys, navigate to the **API Keys** option in the left-hand menu. This will open the **API Keys Dashboard**, which displays a table containing all your registered keys.

Below is a breakdown of the information presented in the API Key table:

| Element | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Name** | A user-provided label for the key, useful for organizing and identifying its purpose. |
| **API Key** | The unique token for accessing the platform. The majority of the token is masked by asterisks for security. |
| **Created At** | The date and time when the API Key was initially generated. |
| **Actions** | Contains a vertical ellipsis (`...`). Clicking this reveals the **Delete** option, allowing you to revoke and remove the API key. |

</Step>
<Step title="Step 3: Securely Record the Token">
You will immediately be shown your newly generated API Key and its complete token. 

<Note> **Crucial Security Step:** Please ensure you **copy the token immediately** and document it in a secure location outside of the Platform. For security reasons, you will **not** be able to view the full token again once this dialog is closed.</Note>

After you have securely recorded the token, click the **Done** button to close the panel and return to the API Keys Dashboard.
