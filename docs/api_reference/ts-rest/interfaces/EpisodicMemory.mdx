## Interface `EpisodicMemory`

Episodic memories represent specific events or interactions in a chronological sequence. Think of these as the individual "moments" the AI remembers.

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `uid` | `string` | The unique identifier for this specific memory entry. |
| `content` | `string` | The actual text or data of the memory. |
| `created_at` | `string` | ISO timestamp of when the memory was stored. |
| `session_key` | `string` | Identifier for the specific session or conversation. |
| `producer_id` | `string` | The ID of the entity (user/system) that created the memory. |
| `producer_role` | `string` | The role of the creator (e.g., `'user'`, `'assistant'`). |
| `episode_type` | `string` | The category of the episode (e.g., `'chat_message'`). |
| `sequence_num` | `number` | The order of this memory within its session. |
| `metadata` | `Record<string, unknown>` | Additional custom data stored with the memory. |

## Interface `SemanticMemory`

Semantic memories represent distilled knowledge, facts, or "truths" extracted from episodes. These are used for high-level reasoning and background context.

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `set_id` | `string` | Identifier for the collection this memory belongs to. |
| `category` | `string` | The high-level classification (e.g., `'user_preference'`). |
| `tag` | `string` | A specific tag for quick lookups. |
| `feature_name` | `string` | The specific trait or feature being described. |
| `value` | `string` | The factual value of the memory (e.g., `'prefers_dark_mode'`). |
| `metadata` | `object` | Contains `id`, `citations` (sources), and `other` custom fields. |

## Comparison: Episodes vs. Semantics



Understanding which model you are receiving helps you format your UI or AI prompts correctly:

```typescript
// Example of handling both types in a search result
results.content.episodic_memory.long_term_memory.forEach((ep: EpisodicMemory) => {
  console.log(`[${ep.created_at}] Event: ${ep.content}`);
});

results.content.semantic_memory.forEach((sem: SemanticMemory) => {
  console.log(`Fact: ${sem.feature_name} is ${sem.value}`);
});
```
