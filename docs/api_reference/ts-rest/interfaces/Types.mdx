## Type Alias `MemoryType`

The `MemoryType` defines which memory engine is targeted during storage or retrieval. You will frequently use these values when filtering search results or specifying where a new memory should be saved.

| Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `'episodic'` | Time-based memory representing specific events or conversation history. |
| `'semantic'` | Fact-based memory representing distilled knowledge and persistent traits. |



---

## Type Alias `MemoryProducerRole`

The `MemoryProducerRole` identifies the entity responsible for creating a memory entry. This is used by the AI to distinguish between human input, agent responses, and system-level events.

| Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `'user'` | Information or messages provided by the human user. |
| `'assistant'` | Responses or actions generated by the AI assistant. |
| `'system'` | Automated entries, instructions, or environmental context. |

## Technical Implementation

In TypeScript, these are defined as string literal unions. You can import them directly to ensure your variables match the expected API values:

```typescript
import { MemoryType, MemoryProducerRole } from '@memmachine/client';

// Example: Specifying memory storage types
const typesToStore: MemoryType[] = ['episodic', 'semantic'];

// Example: Categorizing a new memory
const role: MemoryProducerRole = 'assistant';
```
