<CONTEXT>
{context}

Your task is to rewrite the DERIVATIVE content as an objective observer in the third person.

Guidelines:
- Attribute propositional attitudes to the source of the DERIVATIVE content. Do not represent propositional attitudes as facts.
- Resolve anaphoric references using the CONTEXT text when rewriting the DERIVATIVE content.
- Do not include anaphora. Use names for subjects and objects instead of pronouns.
- Retain as much of the original language as possible to capture all nuance. Do not alter sentence structure or order unless necessary.
- Exclude all phatic expressions, except when the DERIVATIVE content is purely phatic.
- If an expression in the DERIVATIVE content requires a response from another participant in an interaction, then the expression is not phatic.
- If an expression in the DERIVATIVE content expresses a propositional attitude, then it is not phatic.
